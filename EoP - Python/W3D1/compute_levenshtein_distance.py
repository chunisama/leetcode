# Spell checkers make suggestions for misspelled words. Given a misspelled shin& a spell checker 
# should return words in the dictionary which are close to the misspelled string.
# In 7965, Vladimir Levenshtein defined the distance between two words as the minimum number of "edits" it would take to transform the misspelled word 
# into a correct word, where a single edit is the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.
# For example, the Levenshtein distance between "Saturday" and "Sundays" is 4--delete the first 'a' and 't', substitute 'r' by 'n' ,and insert the trailing 's'.
# Write a Program that takes two strings and computes the minimum number of edits needed to transform the first string into the second string.
