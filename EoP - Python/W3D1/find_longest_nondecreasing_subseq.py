# The problem of finding the longest nondecreasing subsequence in a sequence of integers has implications to many 
# disciplines, including string matching and analyzing card games. As a concrete instance, the length of a longest 
# nondecreasing subsequence for the array in Figure 16.15 is 4. There are multiple longest nondecreasing subsequences, 
# e.g (0,4,70,14) and (0,2,6,9). Note that elements of non-decreasing subsequence are not required to immediately 
# follow each other in the original sequence.



# Write a Program that takes as input an array of numbers and returns the length of a longest nondecreasing subsequence 
# in the array.

# redo

# arr = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9]
