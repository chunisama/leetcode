# Write a program which takes as input an array of disjoint closed intervals with integer endpoints, 
# sorted by increasing order of left endpoint, and an interval to be added, and returns the union of the 
# intervals in the array and the added interval. Your result should be expressed as a union of disjoint intervals 
# sorted by left endpoint.
